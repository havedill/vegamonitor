VegaHashrate Monitor.

Note you will have to update the values of some of the variables. This is a work in progress and hasn't been tested for long yet.

Right now it will montior hashrates (XMR-Stak with a logfile output) and last logfile updated time.

I want to add some API stuff to hopefully let me check my rates on the pool as well if needed.
